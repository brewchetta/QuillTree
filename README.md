# QuillTree

I developed the QuillTree project as a means of connecting writers to each other and to writing groups. Still under development, users can currently write out a profile and add multipage stories to their portfolio.

## React

I included the React framework to implement a single page application for this website.

With React-Router I've also created routing around the application since easy linking is always a plus.

## Unsplash API

Users can choose the backgrounds for their profiles and stories through the Unsplash API. Photography from Unsplash adds an extra layer of professional aesthetic to every story.

## Backend
