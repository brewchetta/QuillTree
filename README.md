# QuillTree

I developed the QuillTree project as a means of connecting writers to each other and to writing groups. Still under development, users can currently write out a profile and add multipage stories to their portfolio.

Users can choose the backgrounds for their profiles and stories through the Unsplash API. Photography from Unsplash adds an extra layer of professional aesthetic to every story.
